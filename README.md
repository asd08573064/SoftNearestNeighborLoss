Pytorch implementation of the Soft Nearest Neighbor Loss from the paper "Analyzing and Improving Representations with the Soft Nearest Neighbor Loss".

This implementation is based on the official tensorflow [implementation](https://github.com/abhisharsinha/similarity/blob/master/tensorflow_similarity/losses/softnn_loss.py).
